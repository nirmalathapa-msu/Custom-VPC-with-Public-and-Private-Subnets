Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you’ve defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you’d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud — no VPNs, hardware, or physical data centers required. You can define your own network space, and control how your network and the Amazon EC2 resources inside your network are exposed to the Internet.

What is the importance of having private and public subnets?

The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet can’t. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet.
